**You:**

hello , i want to know some knowledge about rpmbuild

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Hello! I'd be happy to help you learn more about rpmbuild.

Rpmbuild is a command-line tool used to build RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) packages for software distributions on Linux systems. The RPM format is used to package software for easy installation, upgrading, and removal on RPM-based systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora.

Rpmbuild works by taking the source code of a software package, along with any necessary patches, configuration files, and build scripts, and packaging it into a binary RPM package that can be installed on a target system.

To use rpmbuild, you'll need to have the source code for the software package you want to build, along with any necessary dependencies and build tools. You'll also need to create a spec file, which is a text file that describes how to build the package and what files should be included in the resulting RPM.

Rpmbuild has several options and commands that can be used to control the build process and generate different types of RPM packages, such as source RPMs, binary RPMs, and debuginfo RPMs. It also has options for signing packages with GPG keys, verifying dependencies, and specifying custom build environments.

Rpmbuild is a powerful tool for building and packaging software on RPM-based Linux systems. However, it can be complex to use and requires a good understanding of the Linux build process and package management. There are many resources available online to help you learn more about rpmbuild and how to use it effectively.

**You:**

thanks, could you please list some rpmbuild embed vars?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure! Here are some commonly used rpmbuild embedded variables:

1.  `%_topdir` - This variable specifies the top-level directory for building RPMs. By default, this is set to `$HOME/rpmbuild`.
    
2.  `%_tmppath` - This variable specifies the directory for temporary files generated during the RPM build process. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/tmp`.
    
3.  `%_builddir` - This variable specifies the directory where the RPM build process will take place. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/BUILD`.
    
4.  `%_rpmdir` - This variable specifies the directory where the RPM package files will be placed. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/RPMS`.
    
5.  `%_sourcedir` - This variable specifies the directory where the source files for the package are located. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/SOURCES`.
    
6.  `%_specdir` - This variable specifies the directory where the RPM spec files are located. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/SPECS`.
    
7.  `%_srcrpmdir` - This variable specifies the directory where the source RPM files will be placed. By default, this is set to `%{_topdir}/SRPMS`.
    
8.  `%_buildroot` - This variable specifies the root directory where the package will be built. By default, this is set to `%{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-%{release}-root`.
    

These embedded variables can be used in your RPM spec file to reference various directories and files during the RPM build process. For example, you might use `%{_builddir}` to reference the directory where your package is being built, or `%{_sourcedir}` to reference the directory where your source files are located.

* * *

**You:**

If I write a specs file by myself, in the building step , can i use linux command like "cd" , Eg.: cd %\_buildroot/mybuild

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can use Linux commands such as `cd` in the `%build` section of your RPM spec file. The `%build` section is a shell script that is executed during the build process, and you can use any valid shell commands within this section.

For example, if you want to change to the `%{_builddir}/mybuild` directory before running the build command, you can include the `cd` command in the `%build` section as follows:

bash  
`%build cd %{_builddir}/mybuild ./configure make`

This will change to the `%{_builddir}/mybuild` directory, run the `configure` script, and then run the `make` command.

It's important to note that the `%build` section is executed within the `%{_buildroot}` directory by default, so any paths you reference in your commands should be relative to this directory. However, you can use `%{buildroot}` to reference the absolute path of the `%{_buildroot}` directory within your commands. For example:

bash  
`%build cd %{buildroot}/mybuild ./configure --prefix=%{buildroot}/usr make make install`

This will change to the `%{buildroot}/mybuild` directory, configure the package to be installed in the `%{buildroot}/usr` directory, build the package, and then install it in the `%{buildroot}/usr` directory.

**You:**

Thanks.

**ChatGPT:**

You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

* * *

**You:**

My current task is make dpdk rpm package. There is a problem in the front my target : about ninja-build. I cannot found the ninja-build execute file on the internet , only just ninja

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ninja is a build system similar to make, and it is often used with CMake to build C/C++ projects. If your package requires Ninja to build, you can specify the dependency on the Ninja package in your RPM spec file.

On some RPM-based Linux distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS, the Ninja package is available in the official package repositories. You can install it using the following command:

```
sudo dnf install ninja-build
```

On other distributions, you may need to download and install the package manually. You can download the latest version of Ninja from the official website at [https://ninja-build.org/](https://ninja-build.org/) and install it using the following commands:

bash  
`tar -xzvf ninja-<version>.tar.gz cd ninja-<version> ./configure.py --bootstrap sudo cp ninja /usr/bin/`

Replace `<version>` with the version number of the Ninja package you downloaded.

Once you have installed Ninja on your system, you can reference it in your RPM spec file using the `%global` macro. For example, if you want to use Ninja to build your package, you can include the following line in your spec file:

python  
`%global _cmake_generator Ninja`

This will tell CMake to use Ninja as the build system when building your package. You can then use the `%cmake` macro to run the CMake build process, like this:

perl  
`%cmake \   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%{_prefix} \   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \   -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="%{optflags}" \   -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="%{optflags}"`

This will generate the Ninja build files and start the build process.

**You:**

Thanks , I will check it now. thanks!

**ChatGPT:**

You're welcome! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with. Good luck with your RPM package build!

* * *

**You:**

Hi, Could you please explain some mechanism about popd and pushd usage in RPM spec file?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure! `pushd` and `popd` are shell commands that allow you to change the current working directory in a shell script. In an RPM spec file, you can use `pushd` and `popd` commands to change directories during the build process.

The `pushd` command saves the current directory on a stack and changes to the specified directory. The `popd` command removes the top directory from the stack and changes to the directory saved on top of the stack.

Here's an example of how you can use `pushd` and `popd` in an RPM spec file:

bash  
`%install mkdir -p %{buildroot}/mybuild pushd %{_builddir}/mybuild make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}/mybuild popd`

In this example, the `pushd` command changes the working directory to `%{_builddir}/mybuild`, which is where the build files are located. The `make install` command installs the built files into the `DESTDIR` directory, which in this case is `%{buildroot}/mybuild`.

The `popd` command then changes the working directory back to the original directory, which is the `%{buildroot}` directory in this case. The `%install` section then continues with the remaining commands, which will be executed in the `%{buildroot}` directory.

Using `pushd` and `popd` can make it easier to switch between directories in a shell script, especially when you need to change to multiple directories in sequence. They can also help to ensure that you return to the correct directory after executing commands in a different directory.

It's worth noting that while `pushd` and `popd` are useful commands, they are not strictly necessary in an RPM spec file. You can use any valid shell commands to change directories as needed. However, `pushd` and `popd` can make it easier to manage complex build processes that require multiple directory changes.

**You:**

good answer!

**ChatGPT:**

Thank you! I'm glad that you found my answer helpful. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

**You:**

Hello chatGPT, I have a question about meson 's \_\_global\_ldflags.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, I'll do my best to help! What would you like to know about `__global_ldflags` in Meson?

* * *

**You:**

do you familiar with a build tool named: Meson?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, I am familiar with Meson. Meson is a build system that is designed to be fast, easy to use, and cross-platform. It uses a high-level build description language that is similar to Python, and it supports a wide range of programming languages and platforms.

In Meson, the `__global_ldflags` variable is a list of linker flags that are passed to the linker when linking a binary or library. These linker flags are added to the command line after all other linker flags and object files.

The `__global_ldflags` variable is defined in the Meson build file and can be used to specify linker flags that are required by all targets in the project. For example, if your project requires a particular library to be linked, you can add the linker flags for that library to `__global_ldflags` so that they are included in all linker commands.

Here's an example of how you can use `__global_ldflags` in a Meson build file:

less  
`project('myproject', 'c')  # Define global linker flags __global_ldflags = ['-L/path/to/mylib', '-lmylib']  # Define library target mylib = static_library('mylib', sources : ['mylib.c'], link_args : __global_ldflags)  # Define executable target myexe = executable('myexe', sources : ['main.c'], link_args : __global_ldflags)`

In this example, the `__global_ldflags` variable is defined at the top of the Meson build file and contains the linker flags for a library called `mylib`. The library target `mylib` is defined with the `static_library` function and includes the `__global_ldflags` variable in its `link_args` argument. Similarly, the executable target `myexe` is defined with the `executable` function and also includes `__global_ldflags` in its `link_args` argument.

By defining `__global_ldflags` at the top of the Meson build file and using it in all targets that require the library, you can ensure that the linker flags are consistent across the entire project.

* * *

**You:**

I have step back for : where the locatation about "Meson build file"? I just cannot find it

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The Meson build file is a file that describes the build process for your project using the Meson build system. The Meson build file typically has the name `meson.build` and is located at the top-level directory of your project.

When you run the `meson` command in the terminal, Meson looks for the `meson.build` file in the current directory and uses it to generate the build system files that are required to build your project. The build system files are usually located in a subdirectory called `build`.

Here's an example directory structure for a project that uses Meson:

css  
`myproject/ ├── meson.build ├── mylib/ │   ├── mylib.h │   ├── mylib.c │   └── meson.build ├── main.c └── subproject/     ├── meson.build     └── ...`

In this example, the `myproject` directory contains the top-level Meson build file, `meson.build`, and two subdirectories: `mylib` and `subproject`. The `mylib` directory contains a library source code and its own Meson build file, while the `subproject` directory contains another subproject with its own Meson build file.

You would typically open the `meson.build` file in a text editor to define the build process for your project. This file is written in Meson's high-level build description language, which is similar to Python. In this file, you can define targets such as executables, libraries, and tests, specify compiler and linker options, and configure various aspects of the build process.

* * *

**You:**

Please waiting a while. I'm learning the information from you.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, take your time! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

* * *

**You:**

My Puzzled is that how to Add the configuration the link flags about optimization from o1 to o2 ? in meson build system.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To add optimization flags to the linker in Meson, you can set the `link_args` variable for each target to include the appropriate optimization flags.

For example, to set the optimization level to `-O2` for a C executable target, you could add the following line to the target definition in your `meson.build` file:

less  
`executable('myexe', sources : ['main.c'], link_args : ['-O2'])`

Similarly, to set the optimization level for a library target, you could add the following line to the target definition:

less  
`library('mylib', sources : ['lib.c'], link_args : ['-O2'])`

In both cases, the `-O2` flag is added to the linker command line when building the target. You can replace `-O2` with any other optimization flag that you wish to use.

It's worth noting that optimization flags affect the behavior of both the compiler and the linker, so you may want to set optimization flags for both the `c_args` and `link_args` variables in Meson. Here's an example of how to set optimization flags for both compiler and linker:

less  
`executable('myexe', sources : ['main.c'], c_args : ['-O2'], link_args : ['-O2'])`

In this example, the `-O2` flag is added to both the compiler and linker command lines when building the `myexe` target.

* * *

**You:**

OK, I will study those infomation. After new process , I would coming back. Thanks

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

You're welcome! Feel free to ask any questions if you have any trouble implementing this in your Meson build file.

* * *

**You:**

Hello.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Hello! How can I assist you today?

* * *

**You:**

I found the optimization level is a rpmbuild parameter: RPM\_OPT\_FLAGS.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you're correct! The `RPM_OPT_FLAGS` variable is an RPM build variable that contains the optimization flags that are passed to the compiler when building the RPM package.

By default, `RPM_OPT_FLAGS` is set to `-O2`, which corresponds to the `-O2` optimization level for GCC. You can modify `RPM_OPT_FLAGS` in your RPM spec file to change the optimization level that is used for building the RPM package.

For example, you could set `RPM_OPT_FLAGS` to `-O3` to use the `-O3` optimization level for building the RPM package:

bash  
`%build export RPM_OPT_FLAGS="-O3" ./configure make`

Note that changing the optimization level can affect the performance and behavior of your software, so you should test your RPM package thoroughly after changing `RPM_OPT_FLAGS`.

**You:**

Thanks I will try it . see you later.

**ChatGPT:**

You're welcome! Good luck with your RPM build, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions. Take care!

**You:**

Hello , My issue now is : How can I remove 'gnu\_debuglink' section in a .so file .

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To remove the `gnu_debuglink` section from a shared library (.so file), you can use the `strip` utility with the `--remove-section` option.

Here's an example command that removes the `gnu_debuglink` section from a shared library file named `libexample.so`:

csharp  
`strip --remove-section=.gnu_debuglink libexample.so`

After running this command, the `libexample.so` file will no longer have a `gnu_debuglink` section.

Note that removing the `gnu_debuglink` section will prevent GDB from being able to load the corresponding debug symbols file (usually named `libexample.so.debug`). So if you plan to use GDB for debugging your shared library, you should keep the `gnu_debuglink` section intact.

* * *

**You:**

OK , Thanks for reminder. I am just want to konw way a .so file are same after build , but different after rpmbuild step with "BUILDROOT".

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

When you build a shared library (.so file) on your local machine, the library is typically built with full debug information included. This includes the `gnu_debuglink` section, which contains a reference to the separate debug symbols file.

When you package the shared library into an RPM package using `rpmbuild`, the library is installed into a temporary build root directory (usually `/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.XXXXXX/BUILDROOT/`), and any debug symbols are separated into a separate debug symbols package. This is done by default when you use the `%debug_package` macro in your RPM spec file.

During the RPM package installation process, the shared library is then copied from the temporary build root directory into its final location on the target system (usually `/usr/lib/`). However, the `gnu_debuglink` section in the library is not included in the final installed library. Instead, the debug symbols package is installed separately and linked to the library via the `gnu_debuglink` section.

So the reason why the shared library is different after the `rpmbuild` step with `BUILDROOT` is because the `gnu_debuglink` section is stripped from the final installed library, while it remains intact in the library built on your local machine.

* * *

**You:**

so , how about '.comment' section is a .so? after install by hand in my machine 's /usr/local/lib64 , eg.: my dpdk so: librte\_eal.so.21.0

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The `.comment` section in a shared library typically contains version and build information for the library, and is not directly related to debugging.

When you install a shared library manually (e.g., by copying it to `/usr/local/lib64`), the installed library should be the same as the original library file, including any sections such as `.comment`. However, if you install the same library via an RPM package, the `.comment` section may be stripped during the package build process.

To keep the `.comment` section intact in your shared library when building an RPM package, you can use the `%global _strip_libdir` and `%global _strip_binaries` macros in your RPM spec file. Set the `%global _strip_libdir` macro to `false` to prevent stripping of shared libraries, and set the `%global _strip_binaries` macro to `0` to prevent stripping of binaries. Here's an example:

perl  
`%global _strip_libdir false %global _strip_binaries 0  ...  %install make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}`

By setting these macros to false, you can ensure that the `.comment` section (and any other sections) will be present in the installed shared library.

* * *

**You:**

Actually what I doing is try to produce a same .so by dpdk-install command by hand. They contain .comment section , but no .gnu\_debugdata and .gnu\_debuglink sections. Can you spell the code in specs about ,how can i achive the goal：contain .comment section , but no .gnu\_debugdata and .gnu\_debuglink sections.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To achieve the goal of producing a shared library that contains the `.comment` section but no `.gnu_debugdata` or `.gnu_debuglink` sections, you can use the `%global _use_internal_dependency_generator 0` macro in your RPM spec file.

Here's an example of how you can use this macro in your spec file:

perl  
`%global _use_internal_dependency_generator 0  ...  %build # Your build commands here  %install # Your installation commands here  # Remove debuginfo files and sections find %{buildroot} -name '*.debuginfo' -exec rm {} + find %{buildroot} -type f -name '*.so*' -exec chrpath --delete {} + %{__debug_install_post}`

The `%global _use_internal_dependency_generator 0` macro disables the internal dependency generator in RPM, which means that the `rpm` command will not automatically add `.gnu_debugdata` and `.gnu_debuglink` sections to the shared library.

The `find` command and `chrpath` command in the `%install` section are used to remove the debuginfo files and sections, and to remove the `.gnu_debuglink` section (if present). The `%{__debug_install_post}` macro is then used to strip any remaining debuginfo sections from the shared library.

With these modifications, you should be able to produce a shared library that contains the `.comment` section but no `.gnu_debugdata` or `.gnu_debuglink` sections.

* * *

**You:**

Thanks a lot ! I'll try your advices. thanks.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

You're welcome! I hope it helps. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask.

* * *

**You:**

get new error message: chrpath: command not found . when exec sentence: find %{buildroot} -type f -name '\*.so\*' -exec chrpath --delete {} +

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The `chrpath` command is not always available on all systems, and it may not be installed by default on some systems.

To resolve the error message you're seeing ("chrpath: command not found"), you can either install the `chrpath` command on your system or use an alternative command to remove the `.gnu_debuglink` section.

Here are a few alternatives you can try:

1.  Use `objcopy` to remove the `.gnu_debuglink` section:

lua  
`find %{buildroot} -type f -name '*.so*' -exec objcopy --remove-section=.gnu_debuglink {} \;`

2.  Use `strip` to remove the debug symbols and `.gnu_debuglink` section:

python  
`find %{buildroot} -type f -name '*.so*' -exec strip -g -R .gnu_debuglink {} \;`

Note that both `objcopy` and `strip` may also need to be installed on your system if they are not already available.

I hope this helps!

**You:**

my dpdk spec script's var : \_libdir , equal to /usr/lib64 , but the requirement is /usr/local/lib64/. Eg.: %define pmddir %{\_libdir}/%{name}-pmds , point to /usr/lib64/dpdk-pmds , (name=dpdk); but I need the target path is : /usr/local/lib64/dpdk-pmds. How Can i deal this? is there have a embed val point to : /usr/local/lib64 in rpmbuild spec ?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can use the `%{?_prefix}` macro in your RPM spec file to refer to the installation prefix directory, which is set to `/usr/local` by default. You can combine this with the `_libdir` variable to set the correct installation directory for your pmds.

Here's an example:

perl  
`%define pmddir %{?_prefix}/%{_lib}/%{name}-pmds  # This will expand to /usr/local/lib64/dpdk-pmds`

In this example, the `%{_lib}` macro expands to `lib64` on 64-bit systems and `lib` on 32-bit systems. The `%{name}` macro refers to the name of your package (in this case, `dpdk`). By combining these macros with `%{?_prefix}`, you can set the correct installation directory for your pmds.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

* * *

**You:**

I have another question:

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, what's your question?

* * *

**You:**

Because I just want check the install process of rpmbuild . So I want rpmbuild donot remove build folder , and skip to install step. Can I achive?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can skip the `%install` section of your RPM spec file by commenting it out or removing it entirely.

To prevent rpmbuild from removing the build directory, you can use the `--noclean` option when running the `rpmbuild` command. This option tells rpmbuild to keep the build directory after building the package.

So, the command to build the RPM without cleaning the build directory and skipping the install step would look something like this:

css  
`rpmbuild -bb --noclean mypackage.spec`

This will build the package and leave the build directory intact, but it will not install the package.

* * *

**You:**

Thanks. My current command is : rpmbuild -ba /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/dpdk.spec. I want to know : what is the different between "rpmbuild -bb" and "rpmbuild -ba"?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The difference between "rpmbuild -bb" and "rpmbuild -ba" is the level of the build process that is performed.

*   "rpmbuild -bb" only performs the binary build process, which means that it will only create the binary RPM package(s) without performing any other steps, such as source code preparation, configuration, or installation.
*   "rpmbuild -ba" performs the full build process, which includes the binary build process as well as the source code preparation, configuration, and installation steps. This means that it will create the binary RPM package(s) and also install them to a temporary directory to ensure that they are working properly before creating the final package(s).

In summary, "rpmbuild -bb" only builds the binary RPM package(s), while "rpmbuild -ba" performs the full build process, including installation and testing, in addition to building the binary RPM package(s).

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The error message you received indicates that RPM has found files in the installation directory that are not listed in the RPM package. This is generally considered a bad practice, as it can lead to conflicts with other packages, and makes it difficult to manage installed files.

In your case, it seems that the file `/usr/share/doc/dpdk/_static/css/custom.css` is not listed in the RPM package, but is present in the installed files. To resolve this issue, you need to add this file to the list of files included in the RPM package.

You can do this by modifying your RPM spec file (located in the SPECS directory) and adding the following line to the `%files` section:

perl  
`%{_datadir}/%{name}/_static/css/custom.css`

This will include the file in the RPM package and ensure that it is installed with the package. After making this change, you will need to rebuild the RPM package using the `rpmbuild` command.
